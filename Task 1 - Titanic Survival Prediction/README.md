# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the classic **Kaggle Titanic dataset**.  
This notebook was developed as part of my learning journey in **data analysis and machine learning**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Performed **data cleaning** and handled missing values  
- Engineered new features such as `FamilySize` and `HasCabin`  
- Encoded categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)  
- Trained a baseline **Logistic Regression model**  
- Evaluated performance using **Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve & AUC**  

---

## 📊 Results
- **Test Accuracy:** ~82%  
- Strong performance in predicting **non-survivors**  
- Slightly weaker at identifying **survivors**  
- Learned and applied new evaluation techniques such as the **ROC Curve and AUC score**  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Compare performance across different algorithms  
- Apply hyperparameter tuning for further optimization  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
