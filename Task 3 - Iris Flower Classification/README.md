> This project is a classic machine learning classification problem focused on predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. The goal is to build and evaluate a model that can accurately distinguish between three different species: `Iris-setosa`, `Iris-versicolor`, and `Iris-virginica`.

## üìñ Dataset

The project utilizes the **Iris Flower Dataset**, a classic and well-known dataset in the field of machine learning.

* **Source**: [Kaggle | Iris Flower Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
* **Features**: `sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length`, `petal_width` (in cm)
* **Target**: `species` (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

## üìà Project Workflow

1.  **Data Loading and Inspection**: The dataset was loaded using `pandas` to inspect its structure, data types, and basic statistics.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations like pair plots and heatmaps were created with `seaborn` to understand feature relationships.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: The categorical target variable (`species`) was encoded into a numerical format using `scikit-learn`.
4.  **Train-Test Split**: The data was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for unbiased model evaluation.
5.  **Model Training**: A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model was trained on the prepared data.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance was measured using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.

## üìä Results & Performance

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model performed exceptionally well, demonstrating high predictive accuracy on the unseen test data.

* **Key Result**: The model achieved a high overall accuracy, successfully classifying the vast majority of the Iris flower samples.
* **Performance Metrics**: The classification report confirmed excellent precision and recall for each species.
* **Visualization**: The confusion matrix heatmap provided a clear visual confirmation of the model's effectiveness, showing very few misclassifications.
